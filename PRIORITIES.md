# PRIORITIES.md — Development Priorities & Bug Reports

> **This file is YOUR interface to Leopard.** Edit it to direct development.
> Leopard reads this file on every improvement cycle and works on the highest priority items.
> Mark items done with [x] or remove them when satisfied.

## 🎯 Current Goals (highest priority first)

1. [ ] Make the self-improvement loop robust — leopard should recover from failures and keep going
2. [ ] Fix all remaining test failures (frontend tests need DOM environment)
3. [ ] Add integration tests for critical paths (auth flow, message sending, sub-agent spawning)
